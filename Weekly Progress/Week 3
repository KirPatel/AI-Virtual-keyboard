Setting and aligning text : 

In this Virtual keyboard I will first set the location of the letter inside a rectangel
box which will apper on the webcam when the program runs. Keyboar setup is numbers on 
the first row letters on the other three rows and in last there will be "Space" key. The
text is going to be plain letters and the colour is black for printing letters.

Calculations : 

I am going to set and calculate the location where it is going to show on the webcam
when the program runs, and the size of the text and the rectangel box which the text is in.
