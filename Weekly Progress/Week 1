Setup :

In this week I learned python coding language and downloaded and setup the thing which
I am using to make this project. The project I am creating is virtual keyboard which is
based on artificial intelligence. the theory and development of computer systems able to
perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech
recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. I am using Pycharm Community 
for my platform which is a cross-platform IDE that provides consistent experience.

Importing Libraries :

This project is based on Image processing and it uses libraries like Dlib, OpenCV and 
other libraries with the help of which we would be able to detect points on face like 
eyes. After detecting eyes V.K.D will calculate the blinks and compare them with the 
standard MOSS codes with the help of blink detection and eye detection we are able to
find out the Character which a person wants to express.

I am using OpenCV which is a great tool for image processing and performing computer 
ision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face
detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more. It supports multiple
languages including python, java C++. Although, for this article, I will be limiting to
python only.

Mediapipe is Google’s open-source framework, used for media processing. It is 
cross-platform, or we can say it is platform friendly. It is run on Android, iOS,
web, and YouTube servers that’s what Cross-platform means, to run everywhere. Every
YouTube video we watch is processed with machine learning models using MediaPipe.

Loading webcam :

In this project, I have used 1280x720 pixel video footage using imutils. This is 
important as some of the laptop’s webcam only provides fixed height and width which
can be very small and not suitable for this project.
