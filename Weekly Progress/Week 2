Defining the keys : 
 
the keyboard is projected optically on a flat surface and, 
as the user touches the image of a key, the optical device 
detects the stroke and sends it to the computer.
 
Drawing the letter on keyboard : 

To start creating the virtual keyboard, I first created an empty black window.
i call it keyboard and using numpy library I simply created a black image with
the size of 1500 pixels of width and 1000 pixels of height.
Then I can add the keys. Each key is simply a rectangle containing some text.
So I define the sizes and I draw the rectangle. Using two dimensional array this
program it will simply pass the letter and itâ€™s position and run theough a loop so that 
it can appear on the screen while the webcam is on.
