# AI-Virtual-keyboard
Computing is not limited to desktops and laptops; it has found its way into mobile devices like cell phones. In this project, I will create a Virtual keyboard using sensor technology and artificial intelligence. The virtual keyboard should be accessible and functioning with the help of a camera image of a keyboard that will be fetched. The typing will be captured by a camera which will also capture finger movement while typing. So basically, this is giving the virtual keyboard while developing a system that will work as a virtual keyboard with the help of camera image of a keyboard will be fetched. The typing will be captured by the camera, as the camera will capture finger movement while typing. I will use the Python coding language and use the OpenCV which is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. I will use YouTube tutorials and some examples (samples) from the internet which will help me make the project. This project is based on deep learning for detecting the hands. The main objective of the proposed AI virtual keyboard system is to develop an alternative to the regular and traditional keyboard system to perform and control the keyboard functions, and this can be achieved with the help of a web camera that captures the hand gestures and hand tip and then processes these frames to perform the keyboard function such as clicking the alphabets.
