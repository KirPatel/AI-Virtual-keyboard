# AI-Virtual-keyboard
Computing is not limited to desktops and laptops; it has found its way into mobile devices like cell phones. In this project, I will create a Virtual keyboard using sensor technology and artificial intelligence. The virtual keyboard should be accessible and functioning with the help of a camera image of a keyboard that will be fetched. For debugging this program, I will use TensorFlow it allows the me to visualize the construction of the neural network with Tensorboad. The typing will be captured by the web camera, as the camera will capture finger movement which processes these frames to perform the keyboard function such as clicking the alphabets. I will use the Python coding language and use the OpenCV with mediapipe library which is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. To detect input the pynput library allows you me to control and monitor my your input devices such as they keyboard and mouse. I will use YouTube tutorials and some examples (samples) from the internet which will help me make the project. This project is based on deep learning for detecting the hands. AI virtual keyboard system is to develop an alternative system to perform and control the keyboard functions.
